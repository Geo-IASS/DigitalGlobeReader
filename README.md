# Digital Globe Mapper

This C++ class is a "bare bones" class designed to read Digital Globe imagery files (GeoTiff) and meta-data (XML) files. The class has the ability to load imagery data into a set of arrays (1 per band) and to project the imagery onto a ground plane i.e. it can act like a slide projector and project the image it read onto a 2D screen. 

Documentation is extensive both within the documentation files in this repo and inline within the class.
